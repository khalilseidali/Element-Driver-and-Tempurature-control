# Element-Driver-and-Tempurature-control
In this project, a ceramic element is used as a heater (up to a temperature between 300 and 400 Â° C).
The efficient and cost-effective atmega8 processor from atmel is used to process the temperature loop.
LCD display in 2 x 16 dimensions is used to display the temperature as well as changes made by the user.
Also, to receive the temperature, the PT100 precision sensor, 
which is a temperature-variable resistor (thermistor) with a very high accuracy coefficient, has been used.
In this project, the ceramic element works with 220v AC power and also includes the circuit related to the power switching section and the noise-sensitive digital section, so there are considerable electrical considerations in the PCB design of this circuit.
This project includes Datasheet files related to the main consumable parts and schematic files of sections (power supply, analog, AC control, digital or processor) and PCB file which is designed in 2Layers and 4layers.
This file also contains processor code written in C in the Arduino compiler.
